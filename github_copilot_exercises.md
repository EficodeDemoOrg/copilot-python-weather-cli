   - Try: "Following this project's patterns, how would I add a new field to the WeatherData model?"
   - Request: "What are the key conventions I should follow when adding a new service method?"
   - Compare the responses to earlier interactions - they should be more specific and aligned with your project

4. **Refine the Instructions (Optional)**
   - If you notice any missing patterns or inaccurate information in the generated instructions
   - Edit the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to add project-specific details
   - Consider adding information about:
     - Specific coding conventions you follow
     - Common debugging approaches
     - Testing strategies used in the project

   - Follow up with: "Based on the existing WeatherService and WeatherData model, what's the most logical way to integrate alert functionality without breaking current functionality?"
   
   **Step 2: Implementation with Sonnet 4**
   - Switch to Sonnet 4 and say: "Based on the analysis above, generate the code changes needed to add weather alert functionality to the weather CLI. Include alert threshold validation and notification methods."
   - Then: "Now generate the corresponding service changes to handle alert checking and triggering."
   
   **Step 3: Documentation and Git Summary with GPT-4.1/5-mini**
   - Switch to GPT-4.1/5-mini and request: "Get the current git status and create a summary of what files would be changed for this weather alert feature."

## Phase 8: Advanced Prompt Engineering

### Exercise 8.1: Foundational Chat Modes & Prompt Strategies

1. **Explore and Apply Chat Modes According to Their Guides**
    - Open any file in the repo (e.g., `src/weather_cli/main.py` or `src/weather_cli/weather_service.py`).
    - Use each chat mode in `.github/chatmodes/` for its intended workflow:
       - **Implement Mode**: Use this mode to execute step-by-step implementation tasks, focusing on direct code changes and practical solutions for the weather CLI.
       - **Plan Mode**: Collaborate to transform research or requirements into a clear, actionable implementation plan, breaking weather feature work into discrete, reviewable tasks.
       - **Research Mode**: Investigate and gather information relevant to your Python CLI coding goals, ensuring you have the necessary context before starting implementation.
       - **Translator Mode**: Convert code, comments, or documentation between languages or formats as needed for your weather project.
       - **InstructionMaker Mode**: Generate precise instructions or repository rules, ensuring clarity and enforceability for all contributors to the weather CLI.
    - For each mode, perform a representative task (e.g., implement a weather feature, create a development plan, research weather APIs, translate a code snippet, or define a coding rule) and reflect on how the workflow and output differ between modes.

**Learning Goal:** Understand which chat mode is best suited for different coding scenarios and how to leverage custom modes.

### Exercise 8.2: Instructor Chat Mode for Repo Rules

1. **Create and Enforce Repository Rules Using Instructor Chatmode and Prompts**
   - Switch to Instructor chat mode by following the protocol in `InstructionMaker.chatmode.md`.
   - Use the prompt template in `.github/prompts/create-rule.prompt.md` exactly as described to generate a new repository rule (e.g., "All weather service methods must validate API responses before processing.").
   - Ensure you follow the step-by-step process in the prompt: define the rule, confirm its clarity, and document it as instructed.
   - Repeat the process for additional rules (e.g., Python type hints requirements, logging standards for CLI applications), always adhering to the prompt's review and approval steps.
   - Document the finalized rules in a markdown file or as code comments, as specified in the prompt and chatmode guide.

**Learning Goal:** Learn to use Instructor mode and prompt templates to define and enforce repository-wide rules and standards.

### Exercise 8.3: Reusable Prompts

1. **Apply Reusable Prompts According to Their Protocols**
    - Explore the `.github/prompts/` folder and, for each prompt, read its guide to understand its intended workflow and protocol.
       - For implementation tasks, use `implement-prompt.prompt.md` and follow its step-by-step instructions for generating and reviewing code changes.
       - For planning, use `create-plan.prompt.md` and strictly follow its collaborative planning protocol: ingest research, propose strategy, seek approval, break down tasks, and finalize the plan as described.
       - For session summaries, use `summarize-session.prompt.md` and follow its format for capturing key outcomes and next steps.
    - Practice saving and reusing these prompts, always adhering to their review, approval, and output formatting requirements.

2. **Thread Dump Example: Critical Context Handoff**
   - Open `.github/prompts/thread-dump.prompt.md` and review its protocol for context handoff.
   - Simulate a scenario where your chat context is at maximum capacity and you need to hand off work to a new agent instance.
   - Use the prompt to generate a final briefing message that includes:
     - Primary objective of the session
     - Mission log (completed steps, current status)
     - Essential assets (files, data, URLs)
     - Immediate directives (next actions)
     - Constraints & pitfalls (instructions, limitations)
   - Practice formatting your output as a single, precise text message (not a file or code block), following the template in the prompt.
   - Discuss how this protocol ensures seamless continuation of work and why it is important for collaborative or multi-agent workflows.

**Learning Goal:** Develop and apply reusable prompt patterns for common tasks, leveraging provided prompt files for consistency and efficiency.

   **Thread 1: Lead Developer Role**
   - In the first chat, establish the role: "Act as a Lead Python Developer. You are responsible for architectural decisions, code reviews, and ensuring best practices."
   - Ask: "I need to add weather data persistence to this CLI application. What's the overall architecture and implementation strategy you recommend?"
   - Follow up: "Create a detailed implementation plan with data storage considerations and caching strategies."
   - Use the planning chatmode and prompts from `.github/chatmodes/Plan.chatmode.md` if available.
   
   **Thread 2: Tester/Implementer Role**
   - In the second chat, establish the role: "Act as a Python Tester/Implementer. You focus on writing code, creating tests, and ensuring implementation quality."
   - Share the plan from Thread 1 and ask: "Based on this persistence plan, implement the data storage model and caching functionality."
   - Request: "Generate comprehensive pytest tests for the weather data persistence system."
   - Use implementation chatmode from `.github/chatmodes/Implement.chatmode.md` if available.

2. **Cross-Thread Collaboration**
   - Take the implementation from Thread 2 back to Thread 1 (Lead Developer) for code review
   - Ask the Lead Developer: "Review this weather data persistence implementation. What improvements or performance concerns do you see?"
   - Bring the feedback back to Thread 2 (Tester/Implementer) to refine the code
   - Continue this back-and-forth until both roles approve the solution

3. **Leverage Pre-made Agents**
   - Use specialized agents from your chatmodes for specific tasks:
     - Research agent for investigating weather API best practices
     - Performance-focused agent for optimization assessment
     - Documentation agent for creating CLI user guides

**Learning Goal:** Master collaborative Python development using multiple chat threads with distinct roles, simulating real-world team dynamics and leveraging specialized agents for comprehensive project management.
