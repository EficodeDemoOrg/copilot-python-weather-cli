---
Generate a comprehensive completion report for the task just executed.

‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED CONTEXT**: Completed task file must be in context

# WORKFLOW

## Step 1: Determine Status

Classify completion status:
- ‚úÖ **SUCCESS**: All requirements met, DoD complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**: Core functionality complete, some items incomplete
- ‚ùå **FAILED**: Could not complete core requirements
- üõë **BLOCKED**: External dependency prevented completion

## Step 2: Generate Report

```markdown
# TASK COMPLETION REPORT

## Task Identification
- **File**: docs/epic_[name]/tasks/[NN_task_name].md
- **Objective**: [One sentence from task]
- **Status**: [SUCCESS|PARTIAL|FAILED|BLOCKED]
- **Completion Time**: [timestamp]

## Implementation Summary

### Work Completed
Files Created ([N] total):
- ‚úÖ `src/weather_cli/new_feature.py` - [purpose]
- ‚úÖ `tests/test_new_feature.py` - [purpose]

Files Modified ([M] total):
- ‚úÖ `src/weather_cli/main.py` - [what was changed]
- ‚úÖ `src/weather_cli/weather_service.py` - [what was changed]

### Verification Results

#### Definition of Done
- ‚úÖ [DoD item 1]: PASS
- ‚úÖ [DoD item 2]: PASS  
- ‚ùå [DoD item 3]: FAIL - [reason]

#### Quality Checks
- black (formatter): [PASS|FAIL]
- flake8 (linter): [PASS|FAIL with N issues]
- mypy (type checker): [PASS|FAIL]
- pytest (tests): [PASS|FAIL - X/Y passed]
- Test Coverage: [X%] (target: >90%)

## Deviations from Specification

[None | Or list each deviation:]

### Deviation 1: [Title]
- **Original Spec**: [What task said]
- **What I Did**: [What was actually implemented]
- **Why**: [Justification]
- **Impact**: [None|Minor|Major]
- **Risk**: [What might break]

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: [Title]

- **Blocks**: [What this prevents]

## Code Quality Notes

### Patterns Followed
- ‚úÖ Consistent with patterns from `copilot-instructions.md`
- ‚úÖ Uses dependency injection for testability
- ‚úÖ Dataclasses are immutable with `@dataclass(frozen=True)`
- ‚úÖ Complete type hints for mypy --strict
- ‚úÖ API keys redacted in logs (security requirement)

### Technical Debt Incurred
[None | Or list items:]
- **Debt**: [What shortcut was taken]
- **Reason**: [Why it was necessary]
- **Future Fix**: [What should be done later]

- [Pattern to reuse]
- [Pitfall to avoid]

### For Task Specifications  
- [What was unclear]
- [What was missing]
- [What was redundant]

## Commit Readiness
[‚úÖ READY TO COMMIT | ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS REVIEW | ‚ùå DO NOT COMMIT]

Suggested commit message:
```

*Report generated by Implementer upon task completion*
```

## Step 3: Generate Summary

Also output concise version:
```
üìä TASK [NN] SUMMARY
Status: [STATUS]
Files: [N] created, [M] modified
DoD: [X]/[Y] complete
Deviations: [None|N documented]
Ready: [YES|NO] for commit

Full report above ‚Üë
```

## Step 4: Next Steps

Based on status:

### If SUCCESS:
```
‚úÖ Task successfully completed. 
Next: Please review changes and commit.
```

### If PARTIAL:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Task partially complete.
Incomplete items documented above.
Next: Review report and decide whether to:
1. Commit partial work
2. Create follow-up task
3. Retry incomplete items
```

### If FAILED/BLOCKED:
```
‚ùå Task could not be completed.
See issues section for details.
Next: Escalate to Lead Developer for guidance.
