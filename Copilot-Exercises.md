# GitHub Copilot Exercises: Python Weather CLI App

This document provides a series of exercises designed to help you learn and practice using GitHub Copilot features within the context of the Python Weather CLI application. We will cover exploring the codebase, ideating new features, and implementing them using Copilot's capabilities.

**Key Copilot Interaction Points:**

* **Chat View:** Used for asking questions, generating code/tests/docs, and initiating actions. Modes like "Ask" (default), "Edits", and "Agent" might be selectable via a dropdown menu within the Chat view interface itself.
* **Inline Chat:** Quick chat directly in the editor (Default: `Cmd+I` / `Ctrl+I`), often used for quick explanations or edits on selected code. Allows reviewing multiple suggestions using keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Alt+]`/`Option+]` or check the Command Palette for "Copilot: View Next/Previous Suggestion").
* **Participants (`@` references):** Used to bring specific, broad contexts into the chat, such as the entire workspace (`@workspace`) or the VS Code environment itself (`@vscode`). **Important Limitation:** You can only use **one participant** (e.g., `@workspace` OR `@vscode`) in a single chat prompt.
* **Variables (`#` references):** Used to provide more granular context to Copilot (e.g., files `#file`, selections `#selection`, symbols `#sym`, symbol usages/definitions `#usage`, changes `#changes`, codebase structure `#codebase`, web content `#fetch`, last terminal command `#terminalLastCommand`, terminal selection `#terminalSelection`). Variables *can* be combined with a participant (e.g., `@workspace #file:weather_data.py`).
    * **Interactive Selection:** For files, folders, symbols (`#sym`), and usage queries (`#usage`), you typically type `#` and then start typing the name; VS Code's UI will suggest matching items from your workspace for you to select easily (e.g., typing `#weather` might suggest the `weather_client.py` file and the `WeatherService` class symbol).
    * **Drag and Drop:** You can also often drag files or folders directly from the VS Code Explorer into the Chat input area to add them as context.
* **Slash Commands:** Used within the Chat view or inline chat to direct Copilot's actions (e.g., `/explain`, `/tests`, `/fix`, `/new`).
* **Code Completion:** Automatic suggestions as you type.
* **Custom Instructions:** Files like `.github/copilot-instructions.md` can guide Copilot's suggestions for the workspace.

**Note on `@workspace` vs `#codebase` and Participant Usage:**

Both `@workspace` and `#codebase` provide Copilot with context about your entire project or workspace files, serving **essentially the same core function**. However, their usage context can differ:
* `@workspace` is the standard **participant** for general questions about the project, typically used within the default "Ask" mode of the Chat view. As a participant, it adheres to the **one-participant-per-prompt** rule.
* `#codebase` is a **variable** that also refers to the workspace context. You might observe that `#codebase` is particularly effective or required when using specific modes like "Edits" or "Agent" (`/new`), where a deeper analysis or generation based on the entire codebase structure is required. Since it's a variable, it doesn't conflict with the one-participant rule if you needed to use `@vscode` alongside workspace context (though combining `@vscode` and `#codebase` is an uncommon scenario).

These exercises generally use `@workspace` for broad "Ask" queries and `#codebase` when broad context seems needed for Agent/Edit tasks, reflecting common patterns and the potential need for `#codebase` in those specific modes. Feel free to experiment to see what works best in your specific scenario.

**Prerequisites:**

* Visual Studio Code installed.
* GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions installed and configured.
* The Python Weather CLI project (as described in the structure diagram) opened in VS Code.
* An integrated terminal open within VS Code (e.g., View > Terminal).
* Basic understanding of Python and package management (pip).
* An OpenWeatherMap API key set as the `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` environment variable (required for some implementation/testing steps).

* **Aim:** Practice having a conversational follow-up using `#codebase` (or `@workspace`) context.
* **Steps:**
    1.  Choose one idea (e.g., adding forecast data).
    2.  In the Copilot Chat view, ask:
        ```
        #codebase Let's explore adding a 3-day forecast option. How could we modify the application? Would we need new API calls (check OpenWeatherMap docs if needed)? How would the output look different? What classes might need changes?
        ```
    3.  Discuss the approach with Copilot.

### Exercise 2.3: Improving Error Handling (`#codebase`)

* **Purpose:** To identify areas where error handling could be improved.
* **Aim:** Practice using `#codebase` (or `@workspace`) to analyze potential weaknesses.
* **Steps:**
    1.  In the Copilot Chat view, type:
        ```
        #codebase Review the error handling in this application (e.g., in WeatherService, OpenWeatherMapClient, main module). Suggest ways to make it more robust or provide better user feedback for errors like invalid API keys, network timeouts, city not found, or unexpected API responses.
        ```
    2.  Evaluate Copilot's suggestions.

### Exercise 2.4: Assessing Feature Feasibility with API Documentation (`#codebase`, `#fetch`, `/explain`)

* **Purpose:** To determine if a potential new feature (e.g., displaying "feels like" temperature) is supported by the OpenWeatherMap API and how it might be accessed.
* **Aim:** Practice using `#fetch` to consult API documentation when considering new features and `#codebase` to provide context of the current application.
* **Steps:**
    1.  Open the Copilot Chat view.
    2.  Assume you are considering adding a "feels like" temperature reading to the weather output.
    3.  Type the following prompt:
        ```
        #codebase I want to add a "feels like" temperature to our weather display. According to the API documentation at #fetch:https://openweathermap.org/current, is "feels like" temperature data available? If so, which field in the API response provides this, and how might I add it to the `WeatherData` class and the application's output?
        ```
    4.  Review Copilot's response to understand if the feature is feasible with the current API and get initial pointers for implementation.

---

## Section 3: Implement Features using Copilot

**Goal:** Use Copilot's code generation capabilities (autocompletion, Edits mode, agents, slash commands, inline chat suggestions) to implement changes, using `#codebase` where broad context is needed for generation/editing modes.

---

### Exercise 3.1: Adding a New Field (Code Completion & Edits Mode)

* **Purpose:** Add humidity data, use Edits mode.
* **Aim:** Practice completion & Edits mode.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Modify `weather_data.py` (Code Completion):**
        * Open the file. Add `humidity: int` as a new field to the `WeatherData` dataclass. Use code completion for the field definition.
        * Update the `__str__` method to include humidity using completion (e.g., start typing `f"Humidity: {self.hum`).
    2.  **Modify `weather_client.py` (Edits Mode):**
        * Open the file. Find where the `WeatherData` object is created after parsing JSON.
        * **Select the lines of code** within that block responsible for extracting values (like temperature, description) and creating the `WeatherData` instance.
        * Open the Copilot Chat view.
        * **From the dropdown menu** in the Chat input area, select the **"Edits"** mode.
        * In the chat input, **type the instruction** (without any slash command prefix):
            ```
            Extract the 'humidity' integer value from the 'main' section of the JSON response and pass it to the WeatherData constructor along with the existing values.
            ```
        * Press Enter. Copilot should show a diff proposing the changes to your selected code. Review and apply if correct.
    3.  **Modify `main.py` (Display - Code Completion):**
        * Open the file. Find where the weather data is displayed. The humidity should already be included via the updated `__str__` method, but you can modify the display format if needed using code completion.

### Exercise 3.2: Generating Unit Tests (`#` file references, `/tests`)

* **Purpose:** Automatically generate unit tests.
* **Aim:** Practice `/tests` with `#` file referencing (interactive selection).
* **Steps:**
    1.  Open the Copilot Chat view.
    2.  Type `#` and select `tests/test_weather_client.py`.
    3.  Type `#` again and select `src/weather_cli/weather_client.py`.
    4.  Append the following prompt and press Enter:
        ```
        /tests Generate a new pytest test method for OpenWeatherMapClient. It should mock the requests.get call and JSON response (include 'main: { humidity: 85 }') and verify that get_weather_from_api correctly parses the humidity into the WeatherData object.
        ```
    5.  Copy the generated test method into your test file, adjust imports/mocks if needed, and run the tests (`pytest tests/`).

### Exercise 3.3: Refactoring with Edits Mode

* **Purpose:** Modify existing code via Edits mode.
* **Aim:** Practice Edits mode for refactoring.
* **Steps:**
    1.  *(Assumption: `config_util.py` exists with `get_api_key()` reading only the environment variable.)*
    2.  Open `src/weather_cli/config_util.py`.
    3.  **Select the entire body** of the `get_api_key()` method.
    4.  Open the Copilot Chat view.
    5.  **Select the "Edits" mode** from the dropdown.
    6.  In the chat input, **type the instruction**:
        ```
        Refactor this: First, try the 'OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY' environment variable. If None or empty, try loading from a '.env' file using python-dotenv. If still not found, raise a ConfigException indicating the key is missing.
        ```
    7.  Review the proposed diff and apply the changes.

### Exercise 3.4: Creating a New Component (`#codebase`, `/new`)

* **Purpose:** Use Copilot Agents (`/new`) to scaffold.

* **Steps:**
    1.  Open the Copilot Chat view.
    2.  Type the following prompt:
        ```
        #codebase /new Create a new Python module named 'weather_cache.py' in the 'src/weather_cli' package. Include:
        1. A global dictionary cache storage using threading.Lock for thread safety.
        2. A CACHE_DURATION_SECONDS = 300 (5 minutes) constant.
        3. A CacheEntry class (or namedtuple) with 'data: WeatherData' and 'timestamp: float'.
        4. A put(city: str, data: WeatherData) -> None function.
        5. A get(city: str) -> Optional[WeatherData] function checking for non-expired entries.
        Include proper type hints and docstrings.
        ```
    3.  Copilot should propose creating the new file (`src/weather_cli/weather_cache.py`). Review and approve.
    4.  *(Follow-up Task)* Manually integrate this `weather_cache` into `WeatherService` (you could use "Edits" mode for this).

### Exercise 3.5: Reviewing Code Changes (`#changes`, `/explain`)

* **Purpose:** Use Copilot to summarize pending changes.
* **Aim:** Practice using `#changes`.
* **Steps:**
    1.  Make a few small, distinct changes to one or two files (e.g., add a comment in `main.py`, modify the output format slightly).
    2.  **Save the files.**
    3.  Open the Source Control view in VS Code (usually the Git icon). You should see your modified files listed under "Changes".
    4.  *(Optional)* Stage one of the changes, leaving another unstaged.
    5.  Open the Copilot Chat view.
    6.  Type the following prompt:
        ```
        #changes /explain Summarize the main themes or purposes of the current staged and unstaged code changes.
        ```
    7.  Review Copilot's summary of your pending modifications.

### Exercise 3.6: Customizing Copilot with Shared Instructions

* **Purpose:** Influence Copilot generation via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
* **Aim:** Define instruction, observe effect.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Create Instruction File:**
        * In the root of your project workspace, create a folder named `.github` if it doesn't already exist.
        * Inside the `.github` folder, create a new file named `copilot-instructions.md`.
    2.  **Define Instruction:**
        * Open `copilot-instructions.md` and add the following content:
            ```markdown
            # Copilot Instructions for Python Weather CLI App

            ## Python Development Guidelines

            - **Logging:** For application logging, always use the `logging` module. Get logger instances using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Avoid using `print()` statements for routine logging within application logic. Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and log exceptions within except blocks using `logger.exception()` or `logger.error()` with exc_info=True.
            - **Type Hints:** Always include type hints for function parameters and return values. Use `typing` module imports like `Optional`, `List`, `Dict` when needed.
            ```
        * Save the file. *Note: Copilot should automatically detect and use these instructions for subsequent requests in this workspace. It might take a moment to register.*
    3.  **Apply Instruction (Add Logging):**
        * Open the file `src/weather_cli/weather_service.py`.
        * Locate the `get_weather(self, city: str)` method.
        * **Select the entire body** of the `get_weather` method (from the docstring to the return statement).
        * Open the Copilot Chat view.
        * **Select the "Edits" mode** from the dropdown menu.
        * In the chat input, **type the instruction** (notice we *don't* specify *how* to log, letting the instructions file guide Copilot):
            ```
            Add logging to this method:
            1. At the beginning, log the city being requested at INFO level.
            2. After successfully fetching weather_data, log the retrieved temperature at INFO level.
            3. Within the except block, log the caught WeatherApiException at ERROR level, including the exception details.
            Ensure the necessary logger instance is created if it doesn't exist.
            ```
        * Press Enter.
    4.  **Observe Result:**
        * Review the diff proposed by Copilot.
        * **Verify:** Did Copilot add code to get a logger using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`? Did it use appropriate logging methods like `logger.info()` and `logger.error()` or `logger.exception()` for logging, rather than `print()` statements?
        * If the instructions were picked up correctly, the generated code should follow the guideline specified in `copilot-instructions.md`. Apply the changes if they look correct and follow the instructions.

### Exercise 3.7: Full Implementation Workflow (Ideate -> Spec -> Implement -> Refactor)

* **Purpose:** To simulate a small feature development lifecycle using various Copilot capabilities sequentially.
* **Aim:** Practice using Ask mode for ideation/spec, `#` file referencing for implementation guidance, and Edits mode for refinement.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **A. Ideate (Ask):** In Copilot Chat (Ask mode), prompt:
        ```
        @workspace Suggest a simple new feature for this weather CLI app. For example, something related to units or output format.
        ```
        Let's assume Copilot suggests adding a choice between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
    2.  **B. Specify (Ask):** Continue the chat:
        ```
        Generate a short technical specification in Markdown format for adding a command-line option (`--units`) to specify temperature units (Celsius 'C' or Fahrenheit 'F'). Default should be Celsius. Specify required changes to input handling, data storage/processing (if any), and output display.
        ```
    3.  **C. Save Specification:** Copy the generated Markdown spec. Create a new file in the `docs/` directory named `UnitsFeature.md` and paste the content. Save the file.
    4.  **D. Plan Implementation (Ask):** In Copilot Chat:
        ```
        #codebase Based on the feature described in #file:docs/UnitsFeature.md, outline the implementation steps. Which Python files likely need changes, and what are the key modifications required in each (e.g., argument parsing, data model, service logic, output formatting)?
        ```
        Review the plan provided by Copilot.
    5.  **E. Implement Changes (Edits/Ask/Completion):** Based on the plan from Step D:
        * Open the primary file for argument parsing (likely `main.py`). Use Edits mode (selecting relevant sections) or Ask mode (`#file:docs/UnitsFeature.md #file:src/weather_cli/main.py Show me how to add command-line argument parsing for '--units' using argparse.`) to implement argument handling. Use code completion.
        * Open `weather_data.py`. If the spec requires storing the unit or performing conversion, use Edits mode or Ask (`#file:docs/UnitsFeature.md #file:src/weather_cli/weather_data.py Suggest changes needed in this class based on the spec.`)
        * Open `main.py` again (or the relevant display class). Use Edits mode or Ask (`#file:docs/UnitsFeature.md #file:src/weather_cli/main.py Update the output display logic to show the temperature in the selected unit (C or F) and include the unit symbol.`) Apply changes.
    6.  **F. Refine (Edits):** Review the implemented code. Select sections that could be cleaner or more robust. Use Edits mode with prompts like "Refactor this temperature conversion logic for clarity" or "Add error handling if the --units argument is invalid."

### Exercise 3.8: Reviewing Inline Chat Suggestions

* **Purpose:** To practice exploring multiple code suggestions provided by Copilot's inline chat.
* **Aim:** Use inline chat for a simple task and explicitly cycle through the different options Copilot offers.
* **Steps:**
    1.  Open `src/weather_cli/weather_data.py`.
    2.  Select the entire `WeatherData` class definition.
    3.  Open inline chat (Default: `Cmd+I` / `Ctrl+I`).
    4.  Type the prompt: `/doc Generate docstring for this class.` and press Enter.
    5.  Copilot will show its first suggestion.
    6.  **Cycle Suggestions:** Use the keyboard shortcut for viewing the next/previous suggestion (e.g., `Alt+]` / `Alt+[` or `Option+]` / `Option+[` - check VS Code's keybindings or the Copilot documentation if these don't work). Observe if Copilot offers alternative phrasings or formats for the docstring.
    7.  Choose the suggestion you prefer and accept it (often by pressing `Tab` or clicking "Accept").

## Section 4: Optional Advanced Exercises

**Goal:** Explore more nuanced or specialized applications of GitHub Copilot beyond the basic workflows.

---

### Exercise 4.1: Debugging Assistance (Runtime Errors)

* **Purpose:** Practice using Copilot Chat to understand runtime errors.
* **Aim:** Use `#` file referencing and pasted stack traces to ask Copilot for insights.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **(Optional Setup - Induce an Error):** Modify `weather_client.py`. Find where data is extracted from the JSON response, for example, `response_data["main"]["temp"]`. Temporarily remove any error handling or default values around a potentially missing field (like `humidity` if you added it, or even `description`). Alternatively, modify a unit test's mock response to return incomplete JSON.
    2.  **Trigger the Error:** Run the application (`python -m weather_cli "London"`) or the modified unit test (`pytest tests/`) in a way that triggers the error (e.g., using a specific city or relying on the faulty mock data). You should see an error message and traceback (like `KeyError`) printed to the console/terminal.
    3.  **Copy the Traceback:** Select and copy the complete traceback from the terminal output.
    4.  **Ask Copilot:** Open the Copilot Chat view. Type a prompt including the relevant file context (using `#` interactive selection) and the pasted traceback:
        ```
        #file:src/weather_cli/weather_client.py /explain I encountered the following runtime error when running the application. Based on the code in the referenced file and this traceback, what could be the likely cause? What are some potential fixes or checks I should add?

        [Paste the full traceback here]
        ```
    5.  **Analyze Suggestion:** Review Copilot's explanation of the error and the suggested fixes (e.g., adding key existence checks, using `.get()` method with defaults, checking response structure if applicable).

### Exercise 4.2: Commit Message Generation

* **Purpose:** To leverage Copilot for drafting standardized Git commit messages.
* **Aim:** Use the `#changes` context variable to ask Copilot Chat to generate a commit message based on pending code changes.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Ensure Pending Changes:** Make sure you have some uncommitted changes in your workspace (staged or unstaged), perhaps from completing previous exercises.
    2.  **Open Copilot Chat:** Navigate to the Copilot Chat view.
    3.  **Generate Commit Message:** Type the following prompt:
        ```
        #changes /explain Generate a concise Git commit message summarizing these code changes. Follow the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., using prefixes like 'feat:', 'fix:', 'refactor:', 'test:', 'docs:', 'chore:').
        ```
    4.  **Review:** Evaluate the generated commit message. Is it accurate? Does it follow the requested format? You can use this as a starting point for your actual commit.

### Exercise 4.3: Code Review Assistance (Security & Performance) (`#codebase`)

* **Purpose:** To use Copilot as a preliminary reviewer to identify potential areas of concern in the codebase.
* **Aim:** Practice asking targeted questions about security and performance using `#codebase` (often works well for analysis requiring broad context).
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Open Copilot Chat:** Navigate to the Copilot Chat view.
    2.  **Ask about Security:** Type the following prompt:
        ```
        #codebase /explain Review the application, particularly how the OpenWeatherMap API key is handled and how external data is fetched and processed. Are there any potential security vulnerabilities, risks, or recommended best practices being missed?
        ```
        Review Copilot's analysis (it might point out risks if the key were hardcoded, suggest environment variables - which you already use, or comment on input validation if applicable).
    3.  **Ask about Performance:** Type the following prompt:
        ```
        #codebase /explain Analyze the application's code, focusing on areas like HTTP client interactions, JSON parsing, and any data manipulation. Are there any obvious potential performance bottlenecks or suggestions for optimization?
        ```
        Review Copilot's suggestions (it might mention caching - which you could explore, efficient string handling, or minimizing API calls if applicable).

### Exercise 4.4: Exploring Alternative Implementations

* **Purpose:** To ask Copilot for different ways to achieve the same programming task.
* **Aim:** Use `#selection` and `#` file referencing (interactive) to request alternatives.
* **Steps:**
    1.  **Select Code:** Open `src/weather_cli/weather_client.py`. Select the block of code inside the `get_weather_from_api` method that is responsible for parsing the JSON response into the `WeatherData` object (likely involving dictionary access and WeatherData construction).
    2.  **Open Copilot Chat:** Navigate to the Copilot Chat view.
    3.  **Add Context and Prompt:**
        * Type `#selection` (to add selected code).
        * Type `#` and select `requirements.txt`.
        * Append the following prompt and press Enter:
          ```
          /explain Show me an alternative way to implement the selected code's functionality (parsing JSON to a Python object). Could it be done using a different approach like Pydantic models, dataclasses with dacite, or perhaps using the requests library's built-in JSON handling differently? Check the available dependencies. Briefly discuss any trade-offs.
          ```
    4.  **Evaluate Options:** Review the alternative implementation(s) suggested by Copilot. Consider their clarity, efficiency, and dependencies compared to the original code.
